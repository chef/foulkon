   /!\ ATTENTION PLEASE /!\

This is a fork of Tecsisa/foulkon. We intend to upstream all our changes.
But first, we'd like to merge them into _our_ master branch, and consume them,
to ensure that what we upstream is what we need.

For you, dear PR author, this means: please pay attention to the "base fork"
of your PR:

--> If it's for our fork, it should say "chef/foulkon"

    (When you select that, the screen will change and display "base: master")

--> If you want to create an upstream pull request, it should say "Tecsisa/foulkon".


-> Either way, please delete this text before submitting.
